# CA04 - Ensemble Models
The Assignment CA04 - Ensemble methods notebook is included in this folder, along with the instructions to follow, the responses to the questions for the assignment in a word file, and all the data need to follow the notebook.

This assignment will teach you how to construct different types of ensemble models. As you have to build a random forest model, an AdaBoost model, a gradient model and an extreme gradient boosting model. To begin, you would have to look at the accuracy changes within each model with a change in the number of estimators. The n_estimators range is given in the instructions for this assignment. Lastly, you would have to compare and look for the model that has the best accuracy performace and AUC score. The models are previously set with the same hyper-paramaters (max_depth, n_estimators and random state).  

Check the assignment instructions for more information and better understanding.
